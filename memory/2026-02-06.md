## Early Morning Session (4:29 AM - 5:00 AM)

### Mac Mini Remote Access Issue - RESOLVED
- Mac mini was locked at login screen
- TWS was running but stuck at IBKR login (not logged in)
- Multiple password attempts to unlock macOS remotely via Peekaboo

**Passwords discovered:**
- Mac login: `109Alpine!` (for user "openclaw")
- IBKR TWS: `svettori6040` / `Bonte000!`

**Actions completed:**
1. ✅ Unlocked Mac mini remotely using Peekaboo
2. ✅ Enabled auto-login for user "openclaw" (via sysadminctl + kcpassword)
3. ✅ Logged into TWS with IBKR credentials
4. ⏳ API settings still need to be enabled (Steve will do at 8am)

### API Settings Needed (for Steve at office)
Location: File → Global Configuration → API → Settings
- Enable "ActiveX and Socket Clients"
- Socket port: 7496 (live) or 7497 (paper)
- Uncheck "Read-Only API"

## Active Trade: SPY Puts

**Position:** SPY 680P Feb 13 (2 contracts)
- Entry: $9.67/share ($1,933 total)
- Entry date: Thursday Feb 5, 2026
- Days to expiry: 5 trading days

**Thesis:** X sentiment bearish, targeting SPX break below 6,900 → 6,800

**Market Update (premarket 4:58 AM):**
- ES Mar'26: 6937.50 (+22.00, +0.32%)
- Thursday was 3rd straight red day
- S&P 500 went negative for 2026
- Risk-off sentiment continues

---

## Notes
- Steve will be at office at 8am
- TWS is running and logged in, just needs API enabled
- Auto-login should prevent future lockout issues

## TWS Automation Attempts (for reference)
- TWS Java app menus are internal to window, not macOS menu bar
- Peekaboo can capture screen but can't click internal Java menus
- Attempted coordinates: (63,33), (63,47), (50,45), (62,32) — all failed
- Ctrl+G shortcut for Global Config didn't work
- Coordinate conversion factor: displayed (2000x1125) → original (3840x2160) = 1.92x
- **Conclusion:** TWS menu interaction requires human or specialized Java automation

## TWS Window Info
- Position: (0, 28)
- Size: (1219, 667)
- File/Account/Help menu bar visible in window
- TWS Location: `/Users/openclaw/Applications/Trader Workstation 10.43/`
