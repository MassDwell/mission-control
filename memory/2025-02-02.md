# 2026-02-02 — Day One

## Clawson Online

- Initialized as Master Agent / COO for Steve Vettori's business ecosystem
- Configured identity, user profile, and operating principles
- Three businesses under coordination:
  1. **MassDwell** — Modular ADUs (primary)
  2. **Atlantic Laser Solutions** — Laser welding distribution (secondary)
  3. **Alpine Property Group** — Real estate investment/development (foundation)

## Operating Model Established

## Data Architecture Deployed

Built structured data/memory system:
```
data/
├── global/facts.json         # Cross-entity context
├── alpine/facts.json         # Alpine Property Group
├── massdwell/facts.json      # MassDwell
└── atlantic_laser/facts.json # Atlantic Laser Solutions
```

Each namespace contains: decks/, proposals/, contracts/, sops/, financial_models/, emails/, meeting_notes/, marketing_assets/, product_specs/

Facts files seeded with all known context from briefing. Open questions documented for gap-filling.

## Agent Permissions Framework

Codified tool access governance:
- **Shared tools:** doc retrieval, doc/spreadsheet generation, web research, task tracking, facts updates
- **Gated tools:** email (draft only), external comms (draft only), contracts (draft → Clawson → Steve), finance models (agent → Clawson validates → Steve approves)
- **Internal ops:** free handoff, sharing, and collaboration between agents
- Clawson = interface layer between agents and Steve

SOP: `data/global/sops/agent-permissions.md`

## Agent Roster Defined

9 agents documented with system prompts and tool access:

**Cross-functional:**
- `chief_of_staff` - Manager/orchestrator
- `admin_assistant` - Inbox, meetings, tasks
- `marketing_content` - All entities marketing
- `sales_followup` - Leads, CRM, proposals
- `finance_underwriting` - Models, margins, deals
- `doc_proposal` - Client-ready documents

**MassDwell-specific:**

**Atlantic Laser-specific:**

## Clawson Mission Control V1.0 Deployed

Built and deployed comprehensive dashboard system:

**Location:** `/Users/openclaw/.openclaw/workspace/mission-control-v1/`
**URL:** http://localhost:8080

**Features:**
- Hub view with global stats across all entities
- Three isolated entity dashboards (MassDwell, Atlantic, Alpine)
- Overview with KPIs, charts, health heatmaps
- Task management (Kanban board)
- Pipeline visualization (funnel + table)
- Team workload tracking
- Analytics with AI insights
- Settings and data management

**Tech:** Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js, Chart.js (all CDN-based for easy deployment)

**Brand themes pulled from websites:**
- MassDwell: Green (#22c55e) - sustainable, modern
- Atlantic Laser: Blue (#3b82f6) - technical, precise
- Alpine Property: Slate (#64748b) - professional, investment

## Technical Decisions

- **Pivoted from Vite+React to static site:** NPM cache ownership issues blocked npm install. Went pure HTML/JS with CDN dependencies instead.
- **Alpine.js for reactivity:** Lightweight, no build step, perfect for dashboard interactivity
- **Chart.js for visualizations:** Pipeline funnels, revenue charts, trend lines
- **Tailwind CSS via CDN:** Rapid styling without build complexity

## Dashboard Structure
