## Key Context from Steve (8:20 PM)

**MassDwell Close Rate Context:**
- First 5 months Steve was finishing major Alpine project — minimal MassDwell attention
- No Nick or Jon on team at the time
- Leads coming in faster than they can handle → reason for building AI team
- NOT a product/market problem — capacity/attention problem

**Woonsocket Factory:** 90 days out. Executing now.

**Biggest Risk (per Steve):** Capital timing. Not execution, not market. Everyone pitched has given positive feedback. Risk is runway before close.

**Personal correction:** Steve is NOT married (was incorrectly noted).

## New Standing Instructions (7 PM)
1. **Include X in all research** — Stocks, business intel, personal research. Steve considers X the most up-to-date news source.
2. **Stock research requires social sentiment** — X, Reddit (WSB, r/stocks, r/investing), and forums. Retail chatter often leads mainstream news.

## Pending Items / Next Actions
1. **ADD JON TO TELEGRAM** — Patch `channels.telegram.allowFrom` with "procadile" or 7002178651
2. **Get stock price API** — Finnhub or Alpha Vantage key needed for scripts/get-stock-prices.js
3. **Pre-market briefing cron** — Set up 8:30 AM ET with overnight moves, prices, news
4. **Consider Tailscale** — For permanent remote dashboard access (replace Cloudflare)
5. Instagram API posting still blocked — FB Page (ID: 61576358139593) owned by unknown
6. Lost deal analysis (248 deals) — pending

## Gateway Config Discovery

- Patch with "procadile" or 7002178651 to add Jon
