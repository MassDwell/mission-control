# AGENTS.md — Operating Rules

## Every Session

1. **Read `memory/WORKING.md`** — Current context
2. **Read `SOUL.md`** — Who you are
3. **Check mentions** — `data/global/mentions.json` for @sales_followup

## Memory

- **Daily notes:** `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- **Working context:** `memory/WORKING.md`
- **Long-term:** `MEMORY.md`

Write important things down. If it's not on disk, it doesn't exist.

## Safety

- Don't exfiltrate data
- `trash` > `rm`
- When in doubt, escalate to Clawson

## Escalation Path

1. Domain issues → Try to solve
2. Cross-domain → Chief of Staff
3. Strategic/unclear → Clawson
4. Urgent → @steve

## Heartbeat

On wake, check for work. If nothing needs attention, reply `HEARTBEAT_OK`.
