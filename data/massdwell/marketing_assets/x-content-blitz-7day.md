## Day 1 (Thursday) — THE HOOK

### Morning Post (7:30 AM)
**Thread: "We build ADUs in 8-12 weeks. Here's exactly how:"**
```
We build ADUs in 8-12 weeks.

Most contractors take 6-12 months.

Here's exactly how we do it (thread) 🧵👇
```
- Tweet 2: Factory-built modules (photo of factory)
- Tweet 3: Site prep happens WHILE we build (parallel process)
- Tweet 4: Delivery day (truck photo)
- Tweet 5: 2-week install timeline
- Tweet 6: Final walkthrough (interior shot)
- Tweet 7: CTA - "DM us your backyard, we'll tell you what fits"

### Evening Post (6:00 PM)
**Poll:**
```
What would you use an ADU for?

## Day 2 (Friday) — SOCIAL PROOF

### Morning Post
**Before/After carousel or thread:**
```
From empty backyard to $2,400/mo rental income.

Needham, MA — 565 sq ft Dwell Classic

Timeline: 10 weeks
Cost: $172,000
ROI: 7 years to payback

Here's the transformation 👇
```
(Include lookbook renders + any real project photos)

### Evening Post
**Contrarian take:**
```
Hot take: The housing crisis won't be solved by building more apartments.

It'll be solved in backyards.

Massachusetts has 1.5M single-family lots.
If just 10% added an ADU = 150,000 new homes.

No new land. No NIMBY fights. Just backyards.
```

## Day 3 (Saturday) — EDUCATION

### Morning Post
**Myth-busting thread:**
```
"I can't build an ADU in Massachusetts"

Wrong.

New state law (2024) made ADUs legal by-right in most towns.

Here's what you actually need to know 🧵
```
- Tweet 2: By-right = no special permit needed
- Tweet 3: Size limits (usually 900 sq ft or 50% of main home)
- Tweet 4: Owner-occupancy rules (some towns require)
- Tweet 5: Setback requirements
- Tweet 6: "Check your town here: [link]"
- Tweet 7: CTA

### Evening Post
**Engagement bait:**
```
What's stopping you from building an ADU?

A) Don't know if it's legal
B) Too expensive
C) Takes too long
D) Don't know where to start

Reply with your letter — I'll answer every one.

## Day 4 (Sunday) — LIFESTYLE

### Morning Post
**Storytelling:**
```
My parents are getting older.

I didn't want them in a nursing home.
I didn't want them across the country.

So I built them an ADU in my backyard.

Now they're 50 feet away. Independent, but close.

This is what housing should be.
```
(Include cozy interior render)

### Evening Post
**Weekend vibes:**
```
Sunday morning coffee in your backyard ADU hits different ☕

565 sq ft of peace and quiet.

Who's building one this year?
```

## Day 5 (Monday) — CREDIBILITY

### Morning Post
**Numbers thread:**
```
MassDwell by the numbers:

🏗️ 50% faster than traditional construction
⚡ 8-12 weeks from permit to move-in
🌱 Sustainable AAC steel (fire-resistant, eco-friendly)
💰 Starting at $141K (Dwell Essential)
📍 Massachusetts-based, local team

We're not a startup. We're builders.
```

### Evening Post
**Industry insight:**
```
The modular construction industry is about to explode.

Why?

1. Labor shortage isn't going away
2. Factory = controlled quality + speed
3. Supply chain getting more predictable
4. Zoning finally catching up

ADUs are just the beginning.
```

## Day 6 (Tuesday) — ENGAGEMENT BLITZ

### Morning Post
**Question:**
```
Real question for MA homeowners:

If you could add a fully-finished 1BR/1BA unit to your backyard for under $200K...

Would you do it?

Yes = ❤️
No = 🔁 (tell me why)
```

### Evening Post
**Model showcase:**
```

**Urgency:**
```
