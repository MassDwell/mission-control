## MORNING THREAD (7:30 AM)

### Tweet 1 (Hook)

We build ADUs in 8-12 weeks.

Most contractors take 6-12 months.

Here's exactly how we do it 🧵👇
```

```
Step 1: Factory-built modules

While you're getting permits, we're building your ADU in our climate-controlled facility.

No weather delays. No material theft. No wasted time.

Your home is being built before ground is even broken.

Step 2: Parallel processing

Traditional build: Permit → Site prep → Build → Finish (sequential)

Our build: Permit + Factory build + Site prep (all at once)

This alone cuts 2-3 months off the timeline.

```
Step 3: Delivery day

Your complete ADU arrives on a truck.

Walls, roof, electrical, plumbing — all done.

We set it on your foundation in hours, not months.

```
Step 4: The 2-week sprint

Once on-site:
→ Connect utilities
→ Final finishes
→ Inspections
→ Certificate of occupancy

2 weeks from delivery to move-in ready.
```

```
Step 5: You move in (or rent it out)

$2,000-3,000/mo rental income in Greater Boston.

Or your parents move in.
Or your adult kid.
Or your home office.

Your backyard. Your choice.

## SAMPLE REPLIES TO HAVE READY

**On housing affordability posts:**
> "Massachusetts has 1.5M single-family lots. If just 10% added ADUs, that's 150K new homes — no new land needed, no NIMBY battles. The backyard is the solution."

**On construction timeline complaints:**
> "Factory-built modular is changing this game. We're delivering finished ADUs in 8-12 weeks total. Traditional site-built can't compete on speed."

**On multi-generational living:**
> "This is exactly why we started MassDwell. Keep family close, keep them independent. A backyard ADU is the best of both worlds."

**On MA housing policy:**
> "The 2024 ADU reform was huge — by-right permitting in most towns now. The policy finally caught up. Now it's about building."
