# MassDwell X/Twitter Viral Strategy
*Compiled: Feb 4, 2026 | For implementation starting Feb 5*

## Problem Analysis
Current posts get low engagement. Need content that:
- Stops the scroll
- Gets shares and comments
- Attracts potential customers
- Builds brand awareness

## High-Performing Content Types for Real Estate/Construction

### 1. 🏠 Transformation Content (HIGHEST VIRAL POTENTIAL)
**Before/After reveals are the #1 viral format in home/construction**
- Empty lot → Finished ADU timelapse
- "Week 1 vs Week 12" factory build progress
- Interior finish reveals
- "What $150K gets you" comparisons

**Example format:**
```
From empty backyard to rental income in 8 weeks.

[BEFORE] → [AFTER]

This homeowner in Newton is now making $2,400/month. 

ADUs aren't the future — they're now.
```

### 2. 📊 Myth-Busting / "Actually..." Posts
These get high engagement because people love correcting AND sharing corrections
- "You need a massive yard for an ADU" → ACTUALLY, here's what fits...
- "ADUs take years to permit" → ACTUALLY, in MA...
- "Modular = cheap quality" → ACTUALLY, here's our steel frame...

### 3. 🎬 Behind-the-Scenes Factory Content
People LOVE seeing how things are made
- "POV: Your ADU being built in our factory"
- Workers assembling walls (30-sec clips)

### 4. 💰 Money/Numbers Content (High share rate)

- "3 bedrooms. 892 sqft. $270K. Do the math."
- "Rental income potential by town" (local data)
- "Zoning changed in [Town]. Here's what that means for your property value."

### 5. 🗣️ Hot Takes / Controversial Opinions
Engagement through debate (use sparingly)
- "The housing crisis isn't about building MORE houses. It's about building SMARTER."
- "Why I think every new home should come with an ADU-ready backyard"
- "Unpopular opinion: Stick-built homes are becoming obsolete"

### 6. 📍 Local/Community Content

- Spotlight neighborhoods where ADUs are transforming communities
- Partner content with local businesses

### 7. ❓ Interactive/Poll Content
