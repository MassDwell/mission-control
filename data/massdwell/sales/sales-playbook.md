```
Subject: Still thinking about your backyard ADU?

Hi [Name],

It's been a while since we connected about your ADU project at [Address]. 

I wanted to check in and see if your plans have evolved. A lot has changed in the ADU landscape recently:

✅ New financing options making projects more affordable
✅ Streamlined permitting in many MA towns
✅ Our newest designs with even better value

If you're still considering adding space to your property, I'd love to reconnect and share what's new.

Worth a quick call?

Best,
Steve Vettori

**Email 2 (Day 7):** Case Study
```
Subject: How the [Town] family added $X to their property value

[Include relevant case study with photos]
```

**Email 3 (Day 14):** Value Offer
```
Subject: Free site feasibility assessment

Hi [Name],

For homeowners who contacted us earlier this year, we're offering a complimentary site feasibility assessment - no obligation.

We'll evaluate:
- Zoning compatibility
- Utility connections
- Best placement options
- Rough budget range

Interested? Just reply to this email.
```

**Email 4 (Day 21):** Final Attempt
```
Subject: Should I close your file?

Hi [Name],

I've reached out a few times about your ADU project. If the timing isn't right, no problem at all.

Just let me know:
👍 "Yes, let's talk" - I'll call you this week
⏰ "Not now, but later" - I'll check back in 6 months  
👎 "Not interested" - I'll remove you from follow-ups

Either way, I appreciate you letting me know.

Best,
Steve
```

## Objection Handling

### "Too Expensive"
**Response:** "I understand budget is a concern. What price point would work for you? We have options starting at $141K for our Essential model. Plus, many clients use HELOCs which spread the cost over time while the ADU generates rental income. Would you like to see the numbers on how that could work for your situation?"

### "Not ready yet"
**Response:** "Totally understand. Can you share what's holding you back? Is it timing, budget, or something else? I want to make sure I'm providing helpful information for whenever you are ready."

### "Need to talk to spouse/family"
**Response:** "Of course. Would it be helpful if I sent some materials you can share with them? Or we could schedule a call where everyone can ask questions together."

### "Permitting seems complicated"
**Response:** "That's actually one of our specialties. We handle the entire permitting process for you. In fact, in [their town], we've already completed [X] projects. Would it help to hear how smooth that process was for one of your neighbors?"

### "What about resale value?"
**Response:** "Great question. ADUs in Massachusetts typically add 20-35% to property value. We can show you comps in your area. Plus, the rental income potential means the ADU often pays for itself."
