## Template 1: Value Drop (Re-engagement)

**Use when:** Lead went cold 30+ days ago, no recent contact

**Subject:** Quick update on ADUs in [Town] — thought of you

```
Hi [First Name],

Hope you're doing well! I was reviewing our conversations from a few weeks back and wanted to share a quick update.

We just wrapped a project in [nearby town] — a 565 sq ft unit that's now renting for $2,800/month. The homeowner went from permit to move-in in under 12 weeks.

Not sure if the timing is any better now, but I'm happy to share:
• What we learned about [their town]'s permitting process
• Updated pricing for the model you were looking at
• A few photos from recent builds

No pressure either way — just wanted to keep you in the loop in case the stars align.

Best,
Nick Ferreira

## Template 2: Spring Schedule (Urgency)

**Use when:** Lead showed interest, timing was the blocker

**Subject:** Spring build slots opening up

```
Hi [First Name],

Quick note — our spring construction schedule is filling up and I wanted to reach out before it's locked in.

For context: once a unit is ordered, we're typically 8-12 weeks to completion. That means if you're thinking about having something ready for summer rentals (or summer family visits), now's the window.

We've streamlined our process quite a bit since we last talked:
• Site assessment: Same-day scheduling
• Permitting: We handle 100% of it
• Financing: 0% down options available

Would it make sense to hop on a quick call this week? Even if you're not ready to commit, I can lock in a "soft hold" on a build slot while you decide.

Let me know what works.

## Template 3: Honest Reset

**Use when:** Lead went silent after multiple follow-ups

**Subject:** Closing the loop on your ADU project

```
Hi [First Name],

I've reached out a few times and haven't heard back — totally understand if an ADU isn't the right fit right now.

Just want to close the loop on my end: should I keep you on our update list, or would you prefer I hold off?

Either way, no hard feelings. If something changes down the road, you know where to find us.

Take care,
Nick
```
