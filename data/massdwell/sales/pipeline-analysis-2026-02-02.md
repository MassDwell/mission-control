## Loss Analysis Required

248 deals lost representing $6.5M in potential revenue. Need to analyze:
- Common loss reasons
- Stage at which deals die
- Time to loss
- Competitor mentions
- Objection patterns

This data will inform product/pricing adjustments and sales training.

---

## ROI Optimization Recommendations

1. **Focus on Negotiation Stage** - $898K sitting there, close rate optimization here has immediate impact

2. **Reduce Time-to-Close** - Average deal seems to stall, need faster follow-up cadence

3. **Lead Quality Improvement** - Many leads have FB IDs as names, need better form capture

4. **Site Visit Conversion** - Only 2 in "site feasibility completed" - bottleneck

5. **Pricing Transparency** - Many leads don't have price assigned, need better qualification
