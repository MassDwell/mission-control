# Cold Lead Re-Engagement Plan
**Date:** February 3, 2026  
**Minimum Deal Size:** $141,000

---

## Revised Opportunity Analysis

| Segment | Count | Value | Action |
|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| **Qualified High-Value** (≥$141K) | 9 | $2.93M | Priority 1: Personal outreach |
| **Needs Requalification** (<$141K or $0) | 458 | Unknown | Priority 2: Requalify sequence |
| **Total Cold** | 467 | — | — |

**Key Insight:** 98% of cold leads have no proper deal value assigned. This is both a problem and an opportunity — we need to requalify them to find hidden gems.

---

## Revised ROI Projection

**Conservative assumption:** 
- 458 unqualified leads
- 30% have real interest → 137 leads
- 20% qualify at $141K+ → 27 qualified leads
- 15% close rate → **4 deals = $564K**

**From 9 qualified leads:**
- 30% re-engage → 3 leads
- 30% close → **1 deal = $326K avg**

**Total potential: $890K from cold leads**

## Email Templates

### Template 1: High-Value Personal Outreach
**Subject:** Quick question about your ADU project, [First Name]

Hi [First Name],

I was reviewing our project pipeline and noticed we spoke about an ADU for your property at [Address/Town] a while back.

I wanted to check in — is this still something you're considering? A lot has changed since we last connected:

• Our factory is now fully operational (faster builds)
• We've streamlined permitting (less hassle for you)  
• Several projects in [their town/nearby] are underway

If you're still interested, I'd love to schedule a quick call to see where you're at.

Best,
Nick Ferreira

### Template 2: Requalification Email #1
**Subject:** Still thinking about an ADU?

Hi [First Name],

A while back, you reached out to MassDwell about adding an ADU to your property.

I'm reaching out because we're planning our spring build schedule and wanted to see if this is still on your radar.

**Quick question:** What's your current timeline?

→ Reply "NOW" if you're ready to move forward in the next 30 days
→ Reply "SOON" if you're looking at 1-3 months
→ Reply "LATER" if it's 6+ months out
→ Reply "STOP" if you're no longer interested

We build turnkey ADUs starting at $141,000, completed in 8-12 weeks after permits.

Just hit reply with one word and I'll take it from there.

— Nick, MassDwell

### Template 3: Requalification Email #2 (Day 4)
**Subject:** Your backyard could look like this

Hi [First Name],

[IMAGE: Completed ADU project photo]

This is the Dwell Deluxe we just completed in [nearby town]. 594 sqft, 2 bed/1 bath, delivered in 10 weeks.

The homeowner is now renting it for $2,400/month — that's $28,800/year in passive income.

Still thinking about your property at [Address/Town]?

**Reply with your timeline:**
• NOW (next 30 days)
• SOON (1-3 months)
• LATER (6+ months)

### Template 4: Requalification Email #3 (Day 8)
**Subject:** What changed at MassDwell

Hi [First Name],

Quick update on what's new since we last spoke:

✅ **Factory operational** — We build in controlled conditions, no weather delays
✅ **Faster timeline** — 8-12 weeks from permit to move-in
✅ **Financing available** — Home equity, construction loans, even $0 down options
✅ **Permitting handled** — We navigate the town for you

Our ADUs start at $141,000 for the Dwell Essential (470 sqft, 1 bed/1 bath).

Is budget or timing the main factor for you right now? Just reply and let me know — I can point you to the right resources.

— Nick, MassDwell

### Template 5: Breakup Email (Day 14)
**Subject:** Should I close your file?

Hi [First Name],

I've reached out a few times about your ADU project and haven't heard back.

No worries — I know timing isn't always right.

I'm going to close your file for now, but if an ADU is still something you're considering down the road, just reply "KEEP ME" and I'll make sure you stay on our list for updates.

Thanks for considering MassDwell.

— Nick

P.S. — If you went with another company or decided against an ADU, I'd genuinely appreciate knowing. It helps us improve. Just reply with a quick note.
