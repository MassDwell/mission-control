## Competitive Landscape (Pages 12-13)

### West Coast Innovators (3,000+ miles away)
| Company | Focus | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Cosmic Buildings | Robotics | Mobile robotic factories, SoCal |
| Reframe Systems | Factory | Large-scale modular, CA |
| Samara | Template | 5 fixed models, template-based |
| Dvele | High-Tech | Premium prefab ADUs |

*Leading innovation but logistics barrier to Northeast*

### Emerging Players (Limited ADU focus)
| Company | Focus | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| xHomes.ai | NY | Robotics but weak ADU spec |
| Glamni/Imports | China | Doesn't fit US neighborhoods |

### Northeast Traditional (No innovation)
| Company | Focus | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Backyard ADUs | 6-7 mo | Outsourced, long builds |
| LB Modular | Legacy | Full homes only, dated |
| BB Tiny Houses | Manual | Non-factory tiny homes |
| Tektoniks | Panels | Prefab walls, crane assembly |

### The Opportunity
**First AI-driven modular manufacturer in the Northeast**
- ⚡ **1 month production** vs 6-7 months from local competitors
- 🤖 **Robotic precision** - sub-millimeter tolerances no MA vendor offers
- 😊 **AI-powered customization** vs fixed templates or stick-built

→ **Clear path to regional market leadership**
