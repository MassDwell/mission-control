## Talking Points for Steve

1. **"We could do a priced round, but it would slow us down."**
   - Legal back-and-forth takes months
   - We'd rather be building

2. **"The cap gives you the same protection as equity."**
   - If we 5x, you get 5x advantage over Series A
   - You're not betting blind — cap locks your price

3. **"This is how the best companies raise early."**
   - Airbnb, Stripe, Dropbox all started with SAFEs
   - Standard YC docs — investors know them

4. **"We're not asking you to value us. We're asking you to believe in us."**
   - Valuation debates are for later when we have data
   - Right now: factory, units, customers
