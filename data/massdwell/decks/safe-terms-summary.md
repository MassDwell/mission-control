## Overview

MassDwell is raising seed capital via **SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity)** notes. This structure allows early investors to participate in MassDwell's growth while deferring valuation until a future priced round.

## Recommended Terms

| Term | Value | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| **Instrument** | Post-Money SAFE | YC standard, cleaner dilution math |
| **Raising** | $1M - $5M | Flexible based on investor interest |
| **Valuation Cap** | $15M | Ceiling for conversion price (~5x projected 2026 revenue) |
| **Discount** | None | Cap provides sufficient upside |
| **Pro-Rata Rights** | Yes, for $250K+ | Right to maintain ownership % at Series A |
| **MFN Clause** | Yes | Early investors get best terms if later SAFEs issued |

---

## How SAFEs Work

### For Investors
1. Invest now with simple 5-page document
2. No equity issued today — no cap table complexity
3. SAFE converts to equity at Series A (or qualifying event)
4. Conversion price = **lower of:**
   - Series A price, OR
   - Price implied by $20M valuation cap

### Example Conversion
| Scenario | Series A Valuation | Investor Price | Effective Ownership |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Upside case | $45M | $15M cap applies | 3x better than Series A investors |
| Moderate case | $30M | $15M cap applies | 2x better than Series A investors |
| Flat case | $15M | Same as Series A | Equal to Series A investors |

## Why SAFE vs. Priced Round

| Factor | SAFE | Priced Round |
|--------|------|--------------|
| Speed to close | Days-weeks | Months |
| Legal costs | $0-2K | $25K+ |
| Valuation negotiation | Deferred | Required now |
| Board seats | None | Often required |
| Control terms | None | Protective provisions |
| Best for | Pre-traction | Post-product-market-fit |

**MassDwell's Position:** Pre-production with strong pipeline. SAFE lets us move fast, bring on believers, and prove the model before locking in valuation.
