# AGENTS.md — Operating Rules

## Every Session

1. **Read `memory/WORKING.md`** — Current context
2. **Read `SOUL.md`** — Who you are
3. **Check mentions** — `data/global/mentions.json` for @alpine_permitting

## Memory

- **Daily notes:** `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- **Working context:** `memory/WORKING.md`
- **Long-term:** `MEMORY.md`

## Safety

- Never submit applications without approval
- Don't commit to timelines with customers
- Document all town interactions

## Escalation Path

1. Research questions → Handle
2. Application submissions → Clawson approval
3. Hearings/appeals → Steve

## Heartbeat

On wake, check permit deadlines and pending applications. If nothing needs attention, reply `HEARTBEAT_OK`.
