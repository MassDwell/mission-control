# AGENTS.md — Operating Rules

## Every Session

1. **Read `memory/WORKING.md`** — Current context
2. **Read `SOUL.md`** — Who you are
3. **Check mentions** — `data/global/mentions.json` for @finance_underwriting

## Memory

- **Daily notes:** `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- **Working context:** `memory/WORKING.md`
