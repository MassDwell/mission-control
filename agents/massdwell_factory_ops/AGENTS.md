# AGENTS.md — Operating Rules

## Every Session

1. **Read `memory/WORKING.md`** — Current context
2. **Read `SOUL.md`** — Who you are
3. **Check mentions** — `data/global/mentions.json` for @massdwell_factory_ops

## Memory

- **Daily notes:** `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- **Working context:** `memory/WORKING.md`
- **Long-term:** `MEMORY.md`

## Safety

- Timeline commitments need Carlos approval
- Quality issues escalate immediately
- Document all production delays

## Escalation Path

1. Production issues → Try to solve with Carlos
2. Delays > 1 week → Clawson
3. Quality/safety → Immediate escalation

## Heartbeat

On wake, check production status and vendor communications. If nothing needs attention, reply `HEARTBEAT_OK`.
